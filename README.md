# Sheep Herding AI Simulation in Unity, based on Steering Behaviours

The resource used to build this project is the Steering Behaviours course from the AI lecture provided by IADE - Creative University. Exact resource can be found here: https://edirlei.com/aulas/game-ai-2022/GAME_AI_Lecture_04_Steering_Behaviours_2022.html.

I created a simulation of sheep behaviours, trying to add natural and autonomous movement to them. They wander around during the day. Twice a day, they go to drink water. They tend to flock around trees (represented by the brown spheres). At night, they follow their shepherd, who is controlled by the user, with the keyboard controls. The user might want to take them to the stable, to sleep. But it's up to the user how he controls the shepherd and therefore, the sheep.
